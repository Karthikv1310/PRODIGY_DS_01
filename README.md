This is a DataVisualizer, versatile tool designed in Python using Tkinter and Matplotlib libraries for interactive data analysis and visualization. It provides a user-friendly interface to load Excel datasets, visualize data through various plot types such as histograms, bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots, and perform essential data analyses like generating correlation matrices and displaying statistical summaries. Additionally, it includes features to calculate and visualize time and space complexities for algorithmic evaluations. This project demonstrates practical implementation of data handling, visualization techniques, and complexity analysis, making it suitable for educational purposes and exploratory data analysis tasks.
